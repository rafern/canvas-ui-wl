# canvas-ui-wl

[Wonderland Engine](https://wonderlandengine.com/) integration for the
[canvas-ui](https://github.com/rafern/canvas-ui) Typescript UI library.

Documentation is available on [Github pages](https://rafern.github.io/canvas-ui-wl/).

Documentation for canvas-ui is available in the
[canvas-ui repository](https://github.com/rafern/canvas-ui).

## Setup

1. Install the canvas-ui NPM package: `npm install --save-dev @rafern/canvas-ui`
2. Install this NPM package: `npm install --save-dev @rafern/canvas-ui-wl`
3. `require` `@rafern/canvas-ui` and `@rafern/canvas-ui-wl` in your bundle script
4. Create a new component for your UI root ([see examples section](#Examples))
5. Set the material to use for your UI root component to a textured material. If you want a semi-transparent background, create a new pipeline with alpha blending enabled

## Build

To build `canvas-ui-wl`, the type definitions for the Wonderland Engine API must
first be generated (the `types/wonderland/wonderland.d.ts` file):

1. Grab a copy of the `wonderland.min.js` file from a Wonderland Editor project's `deploy` folder and put it inside `types/wonderland`.
2. Run `npm run gen_wle_types`.

The type definition generation only needs to be done once (or when there is a
new API version available). To actually build `canvas-ui-wl`, run
`npm run build`.

### What's with the `.d.ts` generation?

Wonderland Engine doesn't have official type definition files yet. In the
meantime, the files can be generated. This isn't perfect (ctrl+F FIXME), but it
works for now.

To avoid licensing issues, these files must be generated by the user.

## Examples

Example usage can be found in
[example-components](https://github.com/rafern/canvas-ui-wl/tree/master/example-components).

A default virtual keyboard component, `virtual-keyboard-ui-root`, is supplied.
The implementation can be found in
[src/components/virtual-keyboard-ui-root.js](https://github.com/rafern/canvas-ui-wl/blob/master/src/components/virtual-keyboard-ui-root.js).

## Miscellaneous

A component which disables a component of 2 given objects if the keyboard and/or
mouse are in use in a UI root is also provided. The component is named
`canvas-ui-input-guard`.
